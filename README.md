In order to have your pull requests accepted, we recommend you make your changes to BOSS on a new git branch. For example,

```
$ git checkout -b feature/useful-new-thing origin/develop
# Create a new branch based on develop and switch to it
$ ...
# Make your changes and commit them
$ git push fork feature/useful-new-thing \# After new commits, push to your fork
